V 1.0.4 – Minor updates

- UI update to Home page:
  - Subjects can now be re-ordered via long-press + drag.
  - New first-time tutorial appears when there are no subjects, guiding you to add your first one.
  - New in-app “Enjoying Grade Pal?” review prompt:
    - Links directly to the Play Store to leave a review.
    - “Maybe later” snoozes the reminder for 4 weeks.

- UI update to [subject] page:
  - “Remove subject” action moved to the bottom of the page for clarity.
  - Smooth slide animation when navigating between Home and Subject pages.
  - New subject snapshot banner showing:
    - Accumulated grade so far
    - Remaining weight
    - Possible final grade range
  - New “What do I need to pass?” helper card that explains:
    - Whether you’ve already passed
    - If passing is still possible
    - The average % needed across remaining assessments to reach the pass mark
  - Assessment cards can now be tagged and re-ordered:
    - Type tags: Assignment, Exam, Quiz, Hurdle
