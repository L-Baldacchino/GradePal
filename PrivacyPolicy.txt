Developer: Luke Baldacchino / Tera Apps

1. Introduction

Grade Pal (“the App”) is a study-support tool designed to help students track assessment weightings, calculate grades, and manage study sessions.
This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles user data, including what information is collected, stored, or transmitted.

By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

2. Information We Collect
2.1. No Personal Information Collected

Grade Pal does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).

2.2. Local-Only Data

All app data is stored locally on your device only, including:
- Subjects and assessment details
- Grades and results
- Pomodoro logs
- Theme preferences

This information never leaves your device unless you choose to export or share it manually.

2.3. Audio Permission (RECORD_AUDIO)

The App requests the Android permission:

android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO

This is required exclusively for:

✅ Allowing optional haptic/audio feedback in the Pomodoro timer
✅ Supporting optional features such as sound-based alerts or future accessibility functions

The App does NOT:

❌ Record conversations
❌ Upload audio
❌ Store audio
❌ Transmit audio
❌ Use audio for analytics, speech recognition, or profiling

Audio is handled only in real-time on the device for timer-alert functionality.
No audio is saved or shared at any point.

3. Third-Party Services

Grade Pal does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data.

The only third-party interactions are:

✅ Opening external links
- Discord (community support)
- GitHub (open source transparency)
- Buy Me a Coffee (donations)
These links open externally, and their privacy policies apply when used.

4. Data Sharing
Grade Pal does not share any data with:
- Advertisers
- Analytics providers
- Third parties
- Any external servers or databases

The App is completely offline-first.

5. Data Security
Because all data is stored locally on your device:
- You control your own data
- Data exists only in local storage
- Deleting the app or using the “Reset All Data” option removes all stored information permanently
No cloud storage is used.

6. Children’s Privacy
Grade Pal is suitable for users aged 13+ and collects no personal data.

7. Your Rights
Since no personal data is collected:
- There is no stored account to delete
- There is no data profile to export
- All data is managed directly on your device

You may delete all app data anytime through the in-app Danger Zone → Reset All Data option.

8. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated as features change.
You will be notified of major updates through the app or via release notes.
